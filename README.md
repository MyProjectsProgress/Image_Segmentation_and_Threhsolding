## Runing Project
- You have to download OpenCV from this Documentation [link](https://wiki.qt.io/How_to_setup_Qt_and_openCV_on_Windows)
- You can also follow the steps in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOSu-2Oju-A) 

## Description 
Image segmentation and thresholding using the following algorithms: Optimal Thresholing - Otsu Thresholding - Spectral Thresholding - Mapping RGB to LUV - k-means Segmentation - Region Growing Segmentation - Agglomerative and Mean Sift Segmentation. 


## Features 
- User can browse images from his pc to do image processing.
- The project contains 3 tabs:
  - First Tab  -> Contains Optimal Thresholing - Otsu Thresholding - Spectral Thresholding.
  - Second Tab -> Contains k-means Segmentation - Region Growing Segmentation - Agglomerative and Mean Sift Segmentation.

## Technology Used:
The Desktop Application is built using:
- Qt6 Creator using C++.
- OpenCV Library.
